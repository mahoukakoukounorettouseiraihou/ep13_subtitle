1
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,790
Excuse me, everyone!

2
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,330
The elevators have been switched over
to an independent power source...

3
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,790
so they won't stop working due
to the power outage.

4
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,660
Please stay calm and
evacuate in an orderly fashion!

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,290
We have an emergency elevator
one floor below!

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,620
Please use that, as well!

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,240
Brother, what shall we do?

8
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,660
Shizuku, evacuate
with Honoka and your parents.

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,580
Miyuki and I have something to do here.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,910
Shizuku, Honoka, take these.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,990
What is it?

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,450
A flight device.
It has a low battery capacity...

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,410
so only use it to escape if necessary.

14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,910
Got it.

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,790
What about you two?

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,540
Miyuki and I have already prepared
something for ourselves.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,700
Tatsuya, be careful.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,790
You, too, Miyuki. Be careful.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,120
Let's go.

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,490
Mr. Hayama, how much do you know
about what's going on here?

21
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,120
I had information beforehand that the
New Breed Front was plotting something.

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,240
However, I didn't have
any concrete details.

23
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,370
Then, the family couldn't just turn a blind eye?

24
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,120
I suppose that's true.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,830
I would like to prevent this building
from being destroyed if possible, but...

26
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,830
Tatsuya, can you protect this building?

27
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,410
Well...

28
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,700
Miyuki, is it all right with you?

29
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,240
Of course, Brother.

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,990
I'll help, too.

31
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,580
Understood. We'll do it.

32
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,870
Thank you.

33
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,580
Please take Sakurai with you.

34
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,160
She has been trained to be
your personal attendant, Miyuki.

35
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,410
She is still inexperienced,
but I believe she will be helpful to you.

36
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,240
Minami Sakurai...

37
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,080
You seem dependable.

38
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,740
Protect Miyuki.

39
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,620
That's your job.

40
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,450
Certainly!

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,200
Well then, Miyuki, Tatsuya,

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,580
I should get going.

43
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,540
We'll head downstairs, too.

44
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,080
You don't mean by the elevator, do you?
The emergency stairs?

45
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,490
No, we're going to jump.

46
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,080
Let's go!

47
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,740
Now it's our turn.

48
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,790
Minami, are you okay?

49
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,040
Yes. I apologize for being a nuisance.

50
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,870
All right, let's go.

51
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,910
Brother, would you tell me the situation?

52
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,870
Police officers are being shot at from a boat.

53
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,490
The officers returned fire,
and they're engaged in combat.

54
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,620
It seems the enemy is
more organized than I thought.

55
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,950
Five terrorists have taken over
the control center.

56
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,790
Nobody between the second
to the 34th underground floors.

57
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,290
35 people on the 35th floor.

58
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,330
Nobody on the 36th floor.

59
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,450
The 35 people on the 35th floor
are unconscious or in a half-conscious state.

60
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,330
Is that Visual Magic?

61
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,950
It's similar.

62
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,040
Five members of the New Breed Front
have penetrated the building?

63
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,120
That's surprisingly few.

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,370
Well,

65
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,120
it's possible that some of the 35 people
are actually terrorists.

66
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,580
True.

67
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,540
I could tell through direct contact with them,
but I can't be sure just by sight alone.

68
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,950
I wonder if the terrorists will keep their word
and give everyone enough time to evacuate.

69
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,740
If many civilians are caught up
in the building's destruction,

70
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,660
they'll lose the support of magicians
as well as the general public.

71
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,330
If they're reasonable enough
to comprehend that,

72
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,910
I believe they'll wait
until the evacuation is over.

73
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,200
The terrorists?

74
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,580
No, an earthquake!

75
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,080
The elevator has stopped?

76
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,620
There's nothing to worry about.
It'll start up again soon.

77
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,290
ARTHQUAKE WARNING

78
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,290
AN M5.4 EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED IN
TOKYO BAY AT A DEPTH OF 10 KM.
THE SEISMIC INTENSITY IS LEVEL 4.

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,740
This is bad.

80
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,290
Brother?

81
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,910
The seismic intensity is level 4.

82
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,790
The elevator won't start running again
without manual operation.

83
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,910
Are Honoka and Shizuku
still on the elevator?

84
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,620
They're between the 180th and 181st floors.

85
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,740
They should be able to get to the 180th floor
which is closest to them,

86
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,370
but that's nearly a thousand meters
away from the ground.

87
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,290
Can't we do something?

88
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,240
If we can get to the control center
of the first underground floor...

89
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I think I can restart the elevator remotely.

90
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,910
Except there are terrorists
in the control center.

91
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,830
Still, that's the only way.

92
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,160
Let's try negotiating with them first.

93
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,080
VISITOR ARC XIII

94
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,660
Who's your leader?

95
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,370
I want to talk.

96
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,410
I'm the leader, Kan Fehr.

97
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,870
My name is Tatsuya Shiba.

98
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,370
I'd like you to let me use the control center
so I can restart the elevator

99
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,040
which came to an emergency stop
because of the earthquake.

100
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,040
We have confirmed
that the elevator has indeed stopped.

101
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,830
But I can't allow you access
to the control center. We'll deal with it.

102
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,700
You say you'll deal with it,

103
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,040
but do you have someone with the
technical skill to remotely restart the elevator?

104
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,580
This is an urgent situation.
I can release the lock in five minutes.

105
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,450
As long as there is any suspicion
that you are our enemy,

106
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,540
I can't permit you
to enter the control center.

107
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,080
Why? Are you using the center's equipment
to control the explosives?

108
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,740
Go away!

109
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,200
If you quietly return to the surface with the
two young ladies hiding there, we won't attack.

110
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,450
You pointed your guns at me.
I would never overlook that.

111
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,790
Kill them!

112
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,370
What's happening?

113
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,620
Resonance Destruction was used...

114
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,330
to destroy the tower's pillars.

115
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,790
I lost, but...

116
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,080
you can't stop...

117
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,620
the destruction of this building.

118
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,240
Hiroshi Misaki.
This man is an extra from Third?

119
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,540
An extra from the Third Research Institute?

120
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,580
The focus of their research

121
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,490
is how to control multiple types of magic
when they're activated simultaneously, right?

122
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:06,830
Then, while fighting us, was he releasing magic
deep underground to destroy the building?

123
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,080
No, he wasn't the one using magic
but had someone else use it.

124
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,120
Had someone else?

125
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,370
Are you saying that he was controlling
someone else's zone of magic operations?

126
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,290
Not controlling it.

127
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,450
The other person was in agreement
and attuned to him.

128
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,660
There's a Sensory Interference Magic spell

129
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,700
that can be used to guide a magician
into a hypnotic state and have them use magic.

130
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,330
That's the type of magic he used.

131
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,910
Miyuki, Minami...

132
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,700
Yes?

133
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,330
We're going to the lowest level. Follow me.

134
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,370
Right. Um, Brother, what about the elevator?

135
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,700
Unfortunately, we'll have to put that off.

136
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,950
Keeping the building itself
from collapsing takes priority.

137
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,160
Right.

138
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,990
It's crumbling?

139
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,540
By only restoring one of the pillars,
the other three are bearing the load.

140
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,330
At this rate...

141
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,950
No good. Even if I cast Regrowth,
the same thing would happen all over again.

142
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,910
What I'd need to do is cast Regrowth
on all four pillars at the same time

143
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,740
which are well over 2000
meters to restore them fully.

144
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,040
But that'd be equivalent to casting
Regrowth on this entire gigantic building.

145
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,950
Would my brain be able to withstand
the vast amount of information?

146
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,660
The building will collapse in no time now.

147
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,580
Should we escape for Miyuki's sake?

148
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,830
Brother...

149
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,790
That's right.

150
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,830
There are two things I can never betray.

151
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,740
The first is the vow I made to myself
to protect Miyuki to the end.

152
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,080
And the second is...

153
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,580
the faith Miyuki has in me.

154
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,620
Eidos history change...

155
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,040
obtained.

156
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,870
Tower structural information...

157
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,240
obtained.

158
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,660
Information of materials, obtained.

159
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,040
Integrating all...

160
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,450
information.

161
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,830
Build...

162
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,740
with the magic spell Regrowth.

163
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,290
Activate, Regrowth!

164
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,240
This is Tatsuya's power.

165
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,450
Was this the deed of a human?

166
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,910
Should humans be allowed
to have such power?

167
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,040
Brother? Brother? Brother?

168
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,950
I'm fine.

169
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,790
I'm conscious.

170
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,790
But I'm tired.

171
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,160
It's no wonder.

172
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,790
Brother, I'll wake you up
after things are settled here,

173
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,790
so please rest for a while.

174
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,370
Yeah.

175
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,870
I'll do just that.

176
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,500
YOTSUBA MAIN RESIDENCE

177
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,660
So, Tatsuya rescued everyone
from the precarious situation this time.

178
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,660
I am ashamed of myself, ma'am.

179
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,740
So, did you give Tatsuya
the background on this incident?

180
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,660
No, I didn't tell him anything.

181
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
He didn't ask you?

182
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,540
No. After he turned
the terrorists over to us,

183
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,620
he escorted Miyuki home
without asking me a thing.

184
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,830
Not one question?

185
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,120
No, ma'am.

186
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:32,080
However, this is just my speculation,
but I suspect Tatsuya already knows everything.

187
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
That could be.

188
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,330
By the way, what is Minami doing now?

189
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,040
Sakurai is sleeping in her room.

190
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,950
Did you give that thing to her?

191
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,580
Yes. It's in her possession now.

192
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,450
I see. This is something to look forward to.

193
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,660
APRIL 8, 2096

194
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,540
"NATIONAL MAGIC UNIVERSITY
AFFILIATED FIRST HIGH SCHOOL
32nd ENTRANCE CEREMONY"

195
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,830
So...

196
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,740
please guard the premises.

197
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,830
Sure, you can count on me.

198
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,700
I'm going to escort the new students in.

199
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,830
Well, I wonder if there are any new students
this year with any backbone.

200
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,160
You're evaluating new students on the day
of the entrance ceremony? You scare me.

201
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,580
What? You're so rude!

202
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,010
Mizuki...

203
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,370
Tatsuya? What's wrong?

204
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,410
Keep an eye on those two.
Make sure they don't cause a scene.

205
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,740
Will do.

206
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,950
Thanks.

207
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,910
Oh, Tatsuya...

208
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,790
Long time no see.

209
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,740
Well, not really long.

210
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,370
Saegusa?

211
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,700
Good morning.

212
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,450
You're a guide for the new students?

213
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,330
That's right.

214
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,870
Sister!

215
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,410
Who's that?

216
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,580
C-Cut it out, Kasumi!
You're being rude to an upperclassman!

217
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,160
Izumi is right.
Apologize to Tatsuya!

218
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,330
I'm asking who he is!

219
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,790
You two seem awfully close.
Is he your boyfriend, Sister?

220
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,160
B-B-Boy...

221
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,620
Did you escort your younger sisters here?

222
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,870
The auditorium is already open.

223
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,490
You two should go in.

224
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,540
You can sit where you like.

225
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,160
Okay. Thank you.

226
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,410
Well, Saegusa, I'd better get going.

227
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,950
Nyaaa!

228
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,870
Brother!

229
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,540
Miyuki...

230
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,910
Are you a student now
at First High School...

231
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,950
Minami?

232
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,660
Master Tatsuya, a letter from Madam.

233
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,790
Oh...

234
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,160
Minami...

235
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,910
From now on,
you're going to live with us, huh?

236
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,830
That's what it means.

237
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,540
We're glad to have you, Minami.

238
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,370
No, I appreciate you letting me stay.
